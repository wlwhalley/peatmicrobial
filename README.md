# This is my repository for code used during the analysis of data for my PhD - below are explanations for what each file contains:

# columnconverter.R - a very basic script that converts columns in a dataframe to another data type (e.g character to numeric)
# correlationplots.R - another basic script that creates a correlation plot that identifies statistically significant correlations between variables in a dataframe
# hiresexport.R - a basic bit of code that outputs high resolution plots or images from R for publication. Has adjustable resolution and image sizes as well as image types
# otuclustering.R - a script that clusters ASVs identified by DADA2 in a phyloseq object by sequence similarity (default 97%). Requires speedyseq, DECIPHER, phyloseq and Biostrings
# willburndbRDA.R - A script which performs a distance-based redundancy analysis on microbial data stored in a phyloseq object. 
# willburnphyloseq.R - a basic script that manipulates microbial data in phyloseq
